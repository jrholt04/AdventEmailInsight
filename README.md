# AdventEmail Insight 

This small web application leverages SendGrid's API and Microsoft Razor Pages to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring email deliverability. The app allows users to filter and display blocks and bounces from their SendGrid account based on specific date ranges and email addresses. With a sleek and responsive design powered by Razor Pages, users can easily input their desired filters, and the app will query the SendGrid API to retrieve and display the relevant data. This tool is ideal for businesses looking to maintain a clean email list and improve their email marketing performance by quickly identifying and addressing deliverability issues. 
This was a porject I worked on for AdventFS.
