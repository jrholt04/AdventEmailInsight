##AdventEmail Insight 

This is a web App I made using the sendgridAPI client. The goal was simple all it has to do is show all the bounced and or blocked emails that were sent in the selected amount of time and give a reason for why the email was not sent. 
This was a porject I worked on for AdventFS.
